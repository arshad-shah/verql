**Verql** is a fast, cross-platform desktop database client. You connect to your
databases, browse their structure, write and run SQL, visualise results, and
move data in and out — all from one app. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows,
and it's open source ([MIT](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/blob/main/LICENSE),
by Arshad Shah).

Out of the box, Verql speaks **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite**, with
**MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **Snowflake** added by bundled plugins. It includes a
SQL editor with autocomplete, an interactive results grid, ER diagrams, charts,
import/export tools, and a built-in AI assistant — and it can be extended further
with plugins.

> This guide is for people **using** Verql to work with databases. If you want to
> build a plugin or contribute to Verql itself, see the developer docs in the
> [`docs/`](/develop/) folder instead.

## A quick tour

When Verql opens you'll see a three-panel workspace: a sidebar for your
connections and schema, a central tabbed area for editors and table views, and
context panels for details, charts, and the AI assistant.

A typical first session looks like:

1. [Install Verql](/guide/installation/) for your platform.
2. [Create a connection](/guide/connecting/) to your database.
3. [Browse the schema](/guide/exploring-schema/) to see what's there.
4. [Open a query tab and run some SQL](/guide/querying/).
5. [Export the results](/guide/import-export/) — or ask the [AI assistant](/guide/ai-assistant/) for help.
