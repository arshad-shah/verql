Three audiences, three sections.

## For users

End-user documentation for the Verql app — installing, connecting, querying,
and managing plugins. Start at **[guide/README.md](/guide/)**. The
in-app **Help → Verql User Guide** menu links here.

## For plugin developers

| Doc | What's inside |
|-----|---------------|
| [sdk/README.md](/plugins/sdk/) | The `@verql/plugin-sdk` package: what it exports, install, versioning/publishing. **Start here to build a plugin.** |
| [sdk/getting-started.md](/plugins/sdk/getting-started/) | A minimal end-to-end plugin walkthrough. |
| [plugins.md](/plugins/) | The canonical catalogue: every contribution surface (driver, exporter, importer, formatter, type mapper, theme, panel, command, AI provider, settings, …) and how to write one. |
| [plugin-security.md](/plugins/security/) | The plugin trust boundary: the capability/permission model, install hardening, what Verql does and does not enforce, and the roadmap. Read before using `keyring`, `connections`, or `ipc`. |

## For contributors (internals)

| Doc | What's inside |
|-----|---------------|
| [architecture.md](/develop/architecture/) | The whole picture: process model, the `shared/` boundary, main-process subsystems, renderer stores + design system, the plugin model, and two end-to-end data-flow walkthroughs. **Start here.** |
| [diagrams.md](/develop/diagrams/) | A diagram-first visual tour of every subsystem (30 Mermaid diagrams across flowchart, sequence, class, ER, state, mindmap). The companion to `architecture.md`. |
| [ipc.md](/develop/ipc/) | How the renderer talks to the main process. Read this when you need to add or rename an IPC channel. |
| [settings.md](/develop/settings/) | The settings subsystem: the UI → store → IPC → `ConfigStore` pipeline, every category, where each setting is consumed, and the query-history / tab-restore / keybinding-rebind features. |
| [i18n.md](/develop/i18n/) | Internationalization: the dependency-free, cross-process message catalogue (`shared/i18n`), the typed `t()` / `MessageKey`, the renderer `<I18nProvider>`/`useTranslation`, key naming, interpolation/plurals, and how locales + plugin catalogues register. |
| [ai.md](/develop/ai/) | The AI assistant subsystem: providers, the shared tool registry (AI + MCP), the App-Action registry (deep-link chips + agentic UI), the orchestration loop with token budgeting, and persisted/branchable conversation history. |
| [notifications.md](/develop/notifications/) | The notifications subsystem: the host **attention seam** (a delivery-agnostic relay approval flows publish to) and the bundled `os-notifications` plugin. Read before touching approval surfacing. |
| [plugin-audit.md](/plugins/audit/) | How the plugin permission/capability audit works and what it checks. |

**Design records** live in [proposals/](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/blob/main/docs/proposals/): the internal app-data
store, the DB-boundary renderer→plugin migration (plan parsing, error
classification, statement splitting), and signed-plugins/registry. They capture
intent + status for larger changes.

The architecture is **orchestrator + plugins**: `src/main/` is the
orchestrator (window management, IPC plumbing, plugin host) and almost
everything else lives in a plugin under `src/main/plugins/bundled/`.
Adding a new database type or file format means writing a plugin — see
[plugins.md](/plugins/).
