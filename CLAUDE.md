# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Verql** — a desktop database client built with Electron + React. Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite natively, plus MongoDB, Redis, and Snowflake via bundled plugins. Brand assets live in `build/icon.svg` (source of truth) and the in-app `<VerqlMark>` SVG at `src/renderer/src/components/brand/VerqlMark.tsx`. Regenerate platform icons with `pnpm build:icons`.

## Documentation

**Start from the docs, then go to the source.** Before changing a subsystem,
read the relevant doc in [`docs/`](./docs/) to understand the design and the
glue↔plugin boundary, then follow its file references into the code. The docs
are the source of truth for intent; the code is the source of truth for detail.
Read order: `docs/architecture.md` (the whole picture) → the topic doc for the
area you're touching → the source it points to.

- [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) — end-to-end architecture: process model, the `shared/` boundary, main subsystems, renderer stores + design system, the plugin model, and data-flow walkthroughs. **Start here.**
- [`docs/diagrams.md`](./docs/diagrams.md) — a diagram-first visual tour of every subsystem (overall → process/IPC → main → database → plugins → security → renderer → AI → MCP → build). 30 Mermaid diagrams across flowchart, sequence, class, ER, state, and mindmap types. The companion to `architecture.md`.
- [`docs/plugins.md`](./docs/plugins.md) — every contribution surface (driver, exporter, importer, formatter, type mapper, theme, panel, command, AI provider, …) and how to write a plugin.
- [`docs/plugin-security.md`](./docs/plugin-security.md) — the plugin trust boundary: bundled (trusted) vs third-party (untrusted), the enforced/advisory capability model (`keyring`/`connections`/`ipc` gating + manifest `permissions`), **process isolation** (untrusted command/theme plugins run in a `utilityProcess` via the RPC bridge in `src/main/plugins/isolation/`; capability calls are dispatched through the gated context so enforcement stays in one place), install hardening, and known limitations. Read before touching anything that grants a plugin access to secrets, connections, or IPC.
- [`docs/sdk/`](./docs/sdk/README.md) — the published `@verql/plugin-sdk` package (source under `packages/plugin-sdk/`) that external plugin authors consume, plus a getting-started walkthrough. The package re-exports the **electron-free** author surface of `src/main/plugins/sdk`; keep its curated barrel and the `sdk-public-surface` test in sync when changing public exports.
- [`docs/guide/`](./docs/guide/README.md) — end-user (consumer) documentation.
- [`site/`](./site/README.md) — the public documentation site ([verql.arshadshah.com](https://verql.arshadshah.com), Astro + Starlight, deployed on Cloudflare Pages). It curates `docs/` + `docs/guide/` into a branded user guide + developer/plugin docs; the in-app **Help** menu (`src/main/index.ts`) and the published `@verql/plugin-sdk` link here. When you change a subsystem doc, update its `site/src/content/docs/` counterpart in the same change.
- [`docs/ipc.md`](./docs/ipc.md) — adding/renaming a typed IPC channel.
- [`docs/settings.md`](./docs/settings.md) — the settings subsystem: the UI → store → IPC → `ConfigStore` pipeline, the centralized category ids, every category and where each setting is consumed, and the query-history / tab-restore / keybinding-rebind / secrets handling. Read before adding or changing a setting.
- [`docs/notifications.md`](./docs/notifications.md) — the notifications subsystem: the host **attention seam** (a delivery-agnostic relay approval flows publish to) and the bundled `os-notifications` plugin that turns it into native OS notifications. Diagram-rich (context, architecture, sequences, state, class/data models). Read before touching approval surfacing or adding a notification consumer.
- [`docs/activity.md`](./docs/activity.md) — the activity & logging subsystem: the unified in-memory activity stream (queries, tool calls, connections, notifications, network, and `log` diagnostics) for both users and devs, the `logger` service, the IPC **batching** + renderer **pause** that keep a busy stream smooth, and the filter/search/export **Activity panel**. Read before adding a recorder, a log call-site, or touching the activity UI.
- [`docs/ai.md`](./docs/ai.md) — the AI assistant: providers, the shared tool registry, App-Actions, the orchestration loop, and conversation history.
- [`docs/i18n.md`](./docs/i18n.md) — internationalization: the homegrown, dependency-free, cross-process message catalogue (`shared/i18n`), the typed `t()` / `MessageKey`, the renderer `<I18nProvider>`/`useTranslation`, key-naming convention, interpolation/plural syntax, and how locales + plugin catalogues register. Diagram-rich. Read before adding or changing user-facing strings.
- [`docs/onboarding.md`](./docs/onboarding.md) — first-run onboarding & release notes: the VS Code-style **Welcome** "Get Started" tab and the per-version, hand-authored **What's New** release-notes tab, the `settings.onboarding` state + pure startup decision (`lib/onboarding.ts`), the curated release registry (`lib/release-notes/`), and the **agent instructions for authoring a release-notes page**. Read before touching the welcome flow or adding a release page.
- [`docs/tab-persistence.md`](./docs/tab-persistence.md) — restore-on-startup for open query tabs: the incremental, per-tab engine (pure `select` + `diff` core, a debounced/coalesced/serialized write loop, IPC `transport`, one-time localStorage `migrate`) backed by the SQLite app-data `open_tabs` table. Diagram-rich. Read before touching tab restore or the `open_tabs` schema.

When you change a subsystem, update its doc (and this file) in the same change
so the docs never drift from the code.

### Ownership boundary (important)

The main app provides the **UI and the glue** (the registries, IPC, and the ways
logic is invoked). **Plugins own their domain logic.** Database, theme (beyond
the brand baseline), AI, SQL formatting, and import/export logic live in plugins
under `src/main/plugins/bundled/`, never in the orchestrator. When adding a
capability, add a contribution surface + registry (glue) and put the actual
logic in a plugin — don't hardcode dialect/format/provider behavior in the main
app or the renderer.

**DB-agnostic language.** The glue + renderer must describe the database
generically — a driver may not be SQL (Mongo, Redis, future plugins). Don't put
"SQL", "EXPLAIN ANALYZE", "CREATE TABLE", or relational nouns
(table/column/row) in user-facing strings; lean on driver capabilities
(`editorLanguage`, `explain.statement`, and the `nouns` capability —
object/field/record — resolved in the renderer by `useDataNouns`, with generic
fallbacks).

**Reduce code: centralize, don't duplicate.** Before adding a helper/hook, look
for an existing one; when the same logic appears 2+ times, unify it into a
single shared implementation (pure helpers in `lib/`, reusable behaviour as one
flexible hook in `hooks/` — e.g. `useClipboard`, not several copy variants).
See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Run app in development mode (electron-vite dev)
pnpm build            # Build for production (electron-vite build)
pnpm test             # Run all tests (vitest run)
pnpm test -- --run tests/unit/foo.test.ts  # Run a single test file
pnpm storybook        # Start Storybook on port 6006
pnpm postinstall      # Rebuild native modules (better-sqlite3)
```

### Local test databases

Spin up seeded databases to validate connections against every native + bundled
driver. `scripts/test-dbs.sh {up|down|reset|seed|sqlite|status}` runs the
Postgres/MySQL/Mongo/Redis containers from `docker-compose.yml` (seeded from
`docker/seed/`) and builds a seeded `docker/testdb.sqlite` via
`scripts/make-sqlite-testdb.sh`. Connection details (hosts, ports, credentials)
live in [`docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md).

## Architecture

### Electron Process Model

Three-layer split: **main** (Node.js), **preload** (IPC bridge), **renderer** (React SPA).

- `src/main/` — Electron main process: window creation, menus, IPC handlers, database adapters, plugin system, import/export
  - The custom title bar owns the menu on every platform: macOS keeps the native app menu, while Windows/Linux render an app-designed menu bar (`components/shell/MenuBar.tsx` + `menu-model.tsx`) driven by `window:*` IPC (edit roles, fullscreen, reload, devtools, open-external). Window min/max/close use the `IconButton` primitive (`WindowControls.tsx`); a custom in-app About modal (`AboutModal.tsx`) is fed by `app:about-info`.
- `src/preload/` — Sandboxed bridge exposing `window.electronAPI` with typed `invoke()` and `on()` methods
- `src/renderer/src/` — React 19 frontend: components, stores, primitives design system
- `shared/` — TypeScript types and IPC channel definitions shared across processes

### IPC Communication

All renderer-to-main communication goes through typed IPC channels defined in `shared/ipc.ts` (`IpcChannelMap`). Handlers are registered in `src/main/ipc-handlers.ts`. Channel naming convention: `domain:action` (e.g., `db:query`, `connections:save`, `plugins:list`).

### State Management

Zustand stores in `src/renderer/src/stores/`:
- `connections.ts` — Connection profiles, connect/disconnect lifecycle, active connection
- `tabs.ts` — Open tabs (discriminated union: `QueryTab | TableTab | ErDiagramTab | ConnectionFormTab | PluginDetailTab | InstallPluginTab | SettingsTab`)
- `schema.ts` — Schema metadata cache (tables, columns, indexes) keyed by connection+schema
- `ui.ts` — Sidebar/secondary-sidebar/bottom-dock state, active panel, layout dimensions (persisted to localStorage)
- `ai.ts` — AI chat: messages, providers/models, and conversation history persisted to the internal SQLite app-data store via IPC (see `docs/ai.md`)
- `selection.ts` / `notifications.ts` / `toast.ts` — inspector selection, notification center, transient toasts
- `editor.ts` / `tab-actions.ts` — non-reactive registries of mounted Monaco editors and per-tab save/transaction handlers (refs, not reactive state)
- `query-history.ts` — recorded query runs (mirror of the SQLite app-data `query_history` table), capped to `general.maxHistoryItems`; surfaced via the Saved/History toggle in the query sidebar panel
- `lib/tab-persistence/` — the **tab-persistence engine**: an incremental, per-tab restore-on-startup system backed by the SQLite app-data store (`open_tabs` table, over IPC). A pure `diff` + `select` core, a debounced/coalesced `engine` that persists only the tabs that changed (one row per single-tab edit, regardless of how many tabs are open), an IPC `transport`, and a one-time `migrate` from the legacy localStorage snapshot. Restored on startup when `general.restoreTabsOnStartup` is on; persistence runs regardless

### Database Adapters

`DbAdapter` interface in `src/main/db/adapter.ts`. Every driver — including the native sqlite/postgresql/mysql ones — is a **bundled plugin** that implements `DbAdapter` and registers a factory with the SDK `DriverRegistry`. `createAdapter` in `src/main/db/factory.ts` resolves a profile's adapter purely through that registry; there are no special-cased built-ins in `src/main/db/`.

### Plugin System

Plugins live in `src/main/plugins/`. Each plugin has a `manifest.json` declaring contributions (drivers, themes, commands, panels, exporters, importers, connection middleware, connection fields).

**Lifecycle**: discover → validate → resolve → activate → runtime. Managed by `BootCoordinator` in `plugin-host.ts`.

**Plugin SDK** (`src/main/plugins/sdk/`): provides registries (DriverRegistry, ToolRegistry, CommandRegistry, PanelRegistry, ExporterRegistry, …) and access objects (SchemaAccess, ConnectionAccess, PluginSettings) via `PluginContext`. The `ToolRegistry` is shared by the AI assistant and the MCP server — register a tool once and both surfaces see it (gated by the tool's `surfaces` field).

**Bundled plugins** in `src/main/plugins/bundled/`: the native drivers (`sqlite`, `postgresql`, `mysql` — each implements `DbAdapter` and registers via the SDK), `db-tools` (the canonical query/schema tools), `ai` (the assistant — see `docs/ai.md`), `core-formats` (CSV/JSON/SQL exporters + importers), `core-themes`, `ssh-tunnel` (connection middleware), `os-notifications` (surfaces approval/attention requests as native OS notifications via the host **attention seam** — `src/main/attention/` — and exposes an `os-notifications` service for other plugins), `mongodb`, `redis`, `snowflake`.

### AI Assistant & Tooling

The assistant is a bundled plugin (`src/main/plugins/bundled/ai/`). It registers AI providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama) and the `perform_app_action` tool, drives a streaming tool-call loop in `ConversationManager`, and trims each request to a token budget. The renderer (`stores/ai.ts`, `components/ai/`, `lib/app-actions/`) owns the chat UI, the App-Action registry (deep-link chips + agentic UI actions), and persisted/branchable conversation history. Tool calling is unified with the built-in MCP server through the shared `ToolRegistry`. Full detail in [`docs/ai.md`](./docs/ai.md).

### MCP Server

`src/main/mcp/` exposes the shared tool registry to external MCP clients (e.g. Claude Code) over a tokenised endpoint, with the same per-tool permission gating used by the AI chat.

### Design System

Primitives in `src/renderer/src/primitives/` organized by category: `forms/`, `layout/`, `surfaces/`, `data-display/`, `feedback/`, `navigation/`, `typography/`. All use CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant-based styling. Variant names follow the semantic tokens (Button's destructive variant is `error`, not `danger`; Banner has a `success` variant); most primitives expose a `size` variant. `Switch` is a hidden checkbox + visual track driven by `--color-switch-*` tokens; `surfaces/GradientSurface` paints a theme-derived gradient (`tone` × `intensity`).

Three-layer theming in `primitives/theme/tokens.css`: raw color scale → semantic tokens (remapped per theme) → component tokens. Themes: dark, light, midnight. Applied via `data-theme` attribute, managed by `ThemeProvider`.

### Key Libraries

- **Monaco Editor** — query editor with custom completion provider (`lib/monaco-sql.ts`); the language is driver-declared via the `editorLanguage` capability (SQL by default), not assumed
- **AG Grid** — Query results display with custom dark theme
- **@xyflow/react** — ER diagram visualization
- **Recharts** — Chart panel for data visualization

## Build Configuration

- `electron.vite.config.ts` — Main/preload/renderer build config. Native modules (better-sqlite3, pg, mysql2) are externalized from bundle.
- Path aliases: `@shared` → `shared/`, `@` → `src/renderer/src/`
- `electron-builder.yml` — Packaging for macOS (DMG), Windows (NSIS), Linux (AppImage)

## Testing

Vitest with two test projects configured in `vitest.config.ts`:
1. **Unit tests** — jsdom environment, files in `tests/unit/`
2. **Storybook tests** — Browser (Playwright) environment, validates stories + accessibility

Stories located in `src/renderer/src/{primitives,components}/**/*.stories.tsx`.


When working on UI components, always use the `your-project-sb-mcp` MCP tools to access Storybook's component and documentation knowledge before answering or taking any action.

- **CRITICAL: Never hallucinate component properties!** Before using ANY property on a component from a design system (including common-sounding ones like `shadow`, etc.), you MUST use the MCP tools to check if the property is actually documented for that component.
- Query `list-all-documentation` to get a list of all components
- Query `get-documentation` for that component to see all available properties and examples
- Only use properties that are explicitly documented or shown in example stories
- If a property isn't documented, do not assume properties based on naming conventions or common patterns from other libraries. Check back with the user in these cases.
- Use the `get-storybook-story-instructions` tool to fetch the latest instructions for creating or updating stories. This will ensure you follow current conventions and recommendations.
- Check your work by running `run-story-tests`.

Remember: A story name might not reflect the property name correctly, so always verify properties through documentation or example stories before using them.
