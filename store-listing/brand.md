# Brand — shared source of truth

Canonical brand identity and copy for Verql. **Edit messaging here first**, then
adapt it into each store's listing file. Keep this consistent with the in-app
`<VerqlMark>` and the docs site.

## Voice

Confident, precise, developer-to-developer. No hype, no emoji. Say what the user
can *do*, not which file changed. Stay database-agnostic — Verql is not only SQL
(Mongo, Redis), so prefer "databases / data / objects" over "tables / rows" when
speaking generally.

## Taglines

- **Primary:** Fast, extensible desktop database client.
- **One-liner:** Explore, query, and visualize every database from one workspace.
- **Short:** One client for all your databases.

## Short description (~250 chars)

> Verql is a fast, modern desktop database client for developers. Connect to
> PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite out of the box — plus MongoDB, Redis, and
> Snowflake through bundled plugins — then explore, query, and visualize your
> data from one clean, keyboard-friendly workspace.

## Long description

> Verql is a fast, modern, cross-platform database client built for developers
> who live in their data.
>
> Connect in seconds and work across very different databases from a single,
> consistent workspace — PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite are supported natively,
> and MongoDB, Redis, and Snowflake come bundled as plugins. Verql adapts its
> language to each one, so document and key/value stores feel native instead of
> being forced into SQL wording.
>
> Write queries faster with a focused editor (powered by Monaco) that offers
> driver-aware autocomplete and multi-tab editing, and read results in a fast,
> sortable grid that stays smooth on large datasets. Explore without writing
> queries: browse tables, collections, and keys with one click, view interactive
> entity-relationship diagrams, and chart your results.
>
> A built-in AI assistant — backed by OpenAI, Anthropic, or a fully local Ollama
> model — helps you write and understand queries on your own terms. And because
> Verql is built around a plugin system with a published SDK, you can extend it
> with your own drivers, exporters, formatters, themes, and tools.
>
> Connection secrets are stored in your operating system's secure credential
> store, not in plain text. Verql is free and open source under the MIT license.
