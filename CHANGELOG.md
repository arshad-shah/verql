# Changelog

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Make destructive-statement detection driver-aware.

  The "this can change data — run anyway?" confirm no longer assumes SQL for every
  connection. Detection now routes through the statement contribution selected by
  the driver's `statementSyntax` capability (the same mechanism the Run/Explain
  gutter uses), so each driver gets the right semantics:

  - **SQL** — `DELETE`/`DROP`/`TRUNCATE` and an `UPDATE` with no `WHERE`.
  - **Redis** — `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`/`DEL`/`UNLINK`/`GETDEL`.
  - **MongoDB** — `drop`/`dropDatabase`/`deleteMany`/`deleteOne`/`remove`/`findOneAndDelete`.
  - **Any other syntax** — no spurious SQL-keyword warning unless that syntax
    contributes its own `classifyDestructive`.

  A new generic confirm message backs the non-SQL cases. The SQL classifier still
  reuses the pure, unit-tested `destructiveKind` helper.

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Export/import dialogs now show the formats the connection actually supports.

  The Export and Import dialogs no longer hardcode `sql | csv | json`. They fetch
  the formats registered for the active connection (`export:formats-list` /
  `import:formats-list`, driver-filtered through the exporter/importer registries),
  so the list is always correct — a MongoDB or Redis connection is no longer
  offered a SQL export it can't produce.

  - `RegisteredExporter` gains an optional `supportsSchema` flag (the SQL exporters
    set it); the "include schema definition" toggle now shows for any format that
    declares it, instead of being hardcoded to `sql`.
  - The Import dialog branches on the importer's `driverExecutes` flag (SQL scripts
    run their own statements; data files parse into a target object) rather than on
    the literal format name.
  - `export:table`'s `format` is now a registry id (`string`), not a fixed enum, so
    plugin-contributed formats work end to end.

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Persist open tabs incrementally to SQLite instead of localStorage.

  Restore-on-startup for open query tabs moves off a renderer-`localStorage`
  snapshot — which rewrote _every_ tab on _every_ change, synchronously on the UI
  thread, and silently dropped saves at the ~5 MB origin quota — and onto the
  existing main-process SQLite app-data store, behind a per-tab-incremental engine.

  - **Durable layer** — a new `open_tabs` table (one row per tab); `listOpenTabs()`
    / `applyOpenTabOps()` apply an upsert/delete/active batch in a single
    transaction, over two typed IPC channels.
  - **Engine** (`src/renderer/src/lib/tab-persistence/`) — a pure `select` +
    `diff` core (a single-tab edit yields exactly one row write, regardless of tab
    count), a debounced/coalesced/serialized write loop whose baseline only
    advances after a successful write (so a failed write retries instead of being
    lost), an IPC transport, and a one-time migration of the legacy localStorage
    payload.
  - Tabs keep their identity across restore, so writes stay incremental. The
    persisted query buffer is treated as **opaque, driver-agnostic text** (SQL,
    MongoDB, Redis, …) — never parsed.

  Result: tab writes leave the UI thread, cost is bounded by what changed, there's
  no quota cliff, and commits are crash-safe (WAL). Existing localStorage tabs are
  migrated automatically on first launch.

### Patch Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/109) [`4cc3495`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/4cc3495e36219ed11690284ee26e4a6a7a3aa143) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Modernize the release pipeline. The "Version Packages" step now uses the
  canonical `changesets/action` (SHA-pinned) instead of a hand-rolled script —
  fixing the `GITHUB_TOKEN`/changelog-github failure that broke versioning &
  tagging — while the gated, PAT-free auto-tag → reusable-publish flow is
  unchanged. Adds Microsoft Store (MSIX) publishing: an `appx` target in
  `electron-builder.yml` and a `publish-msstore` job in `release.yml`, gated
  behind the `release` environment and skipped until `MICROSOFT_STORE_PRODUCT_ID`
  is set. The `setup-release-gates.sh` script now also provisions the
  `npm-publish` environment and the "Actions can create PRs" permission.

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Make the shared error hints driver-neutral.

  The error-classification system already keeps messages renderer-owned and i18n'd
  (drivers contribute only regex→code patterns via `errorRules`, which carry no
  text), and a `DbErrorCode` is a cross-driver taxonomy. Several fallback **hints**
  still baked in SQL syntax, so a MongoDB/Redis user hitting a shared code (timeout,
  permission denied, type mismatch, …) saw SQL-only advice. Those hints are now
  phrased generically:

  - timeout — "return less data (filter the results or fetch fewer records)"
    instead of "add a WHERE / LIMIT"
  - permission denied — "grant them to this user" instead of "GRANT SELECT, ..."
  - type mismatch — "cast or convert the value explicitly" instead of "value::int"
  - division by zero — "guard the denominator so it can never be zero" instead of
    "NULLIF(x, 0)"
  - transaction aborted — "roll back the transaction" instead of "Run \`ROLLBACK\`"
  - duplicate object — "a create-if-not-exists form, or remove the existing
    {object} first" instead of "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS"

  The driver-specific destructive-run warnings (DELETE/DROP/TRUNCATE) are unchanged
  — they now surface only for SQL connections via the driver-aware classifier.

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Build the main-process app logger on `@arshad-shah/log-kit`.

  The hand-rolled logger core is replaced by log-kit while the app's narrow
  four-level `Logger` facade (serialised `detail`, `child(scope)`) stays
  byte-for-byte compatible — every existing call site is unchanged.

  - log-kit owns the record pipeline (level gating, child-scope nesting) and fans
    each record out to two app-supplied transports with **failure isolation**: a
    throwing activity sink can no longer break console output, and vice versa.
  - The transports preserve existing behaviour exactly — a console transport keeps
    the `[scope] message` format and level→method mapping (info → `console.log`),
    and an activity transport records `log` entries into the unified activity
    stream.
  - Adds `logger.mark(label)` perf markers (recording `durationMs`); plugin boot is
    wired through it as the first use.

  No user-facing behavior change.

- [#108](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/108) [`3f57477`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3f57477b20c86dc15f232b3061aea0797cf669e7) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Security hardening (defense-in-depth).

  - **Secret-redacting logger.** The app logger now recursively redacts
    secret-looking object keys (`password`, `token`, `*key`, `secret`,
    `authorization`, `credential`) before serialising a detail object to the
    console or the persisted activity stream — so a careless call site that logs a
    whole `ConnectionProfile` (which holds plaintext secrets in memory) can't leak
    credentials. Free-text strings/stacks are unchanged; non-secret fields are
    preserved verbatim.
  - **Explicit zip-slip guard on plugin install.** Before extracting a third-party
    plugin archive, the entry names are validated and any absolute path, Windows
    drive-letter path, or `..` traversal segment is rejected — defense-in-depth
    that no longer trusts `unzip`'s implicit stripping across versions/platforms.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#107](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/107) [`b64dc8b`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/b64dc8b87d5dcaece348c3bf5a6c97cde7e925ce) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Add first-run onboarding and per-version release notes, VS Code-style.

  - **Welcome tab** — a "Get Started" walkthrough that opens on a fresh install:
    a brand hero, quick actions (new connection / query / plugins), an interactive
    setup checklist whose steps auto-complete from app state, and learn/resource
    links. Re-openable any time from Help → Welcome, the command palette, or AI.
  - **What's New tab** — a hand-authored, per-version release-notes page (titled
    after the version) that opens automatically after an update when a curated
    entry exists, and from Help → What's New. Content lives in a typed registry
    (`lib/release-notes/`) with authoring instructions in `docs/onboarding.md`.
  - New `settings.onboarding` state (`lastSeenVersion`, `completedSteps`,
    `hideOnStartup`) drives a pure, unit-tested startup decision; the Welcome and
    release surfaces are also exposed as `open-welcome` / `open-release-notes`
    app-actions.

### Patch Changes

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Centralize two more duplicated main-process patterns.

  - **`broadcast(event, ...payload)`** (`src/main/ipc/broadcast.ts`) replaces the
    hand-rolled `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()` send-loop that was copied across
    the IPC handlers, plugins/updater/MCP/settings subsystems. It's typed by
    `IpcEventMap`, so a wrong broadcast payload is now a compile error. (The MCP
    approval send keeps its own path — it early-returns when no window exists.)
  - **`errorMessage(err)`** (`shared/errors.ts`) replaces the
    `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` idiom hand-rolled in 13
    places across the main process and renderer.
  - Fix the `settings:changed` event type: it's declared as two positional args
    (`keyPath`, `value`) to match what the main process sends and the renderer
    listener reads — the previous single-object payload type was inaccurate.

  No runtime behavior change.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Reduce duplicated code by centralizing shared helpers and hooks.

  - `formatCompactNumber` (lib/format.ts) replaces three identical row/token
    number formatters; `formatRelativeTime` / `formatClockTime` (lib/format-time.ts)
    replace the per-file time formatters (and give NotificationItem the i18n it
    was missing).
  - One `useClipboard()` hook replaces the two narrow copy hooks and an inline
    copy variant: it exposes a transient `copied` flag and an optional success
    toast via `copy(text, { toast })`, covering every copy surface (code blocks,
    chat messages, notifications, and the explorer's context menus / hover
    actions).

  CONTRIBUTING.md and CLAUDE.md now document this "centralize, don't duplicate"
  requirement.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Apply the driver `nouns` capability to every relational label, completing the
  DB-agnostic explorer. The context-menu / hover / export / copy labels and the
  query-semantic error messages (not-found, duplicate, constraint, type-mismatch)
  now read in the active driver's own terms (table/column/row, collection/field/
  document, key/field/entry, …) with generic fallbacks. Noun resolution is
  centralized in `lib/data-nouns.ts`.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Make the schema explorer DB-agnostic via a driver-supplied `nouns` capability.

  Drivers can now declare what they call their data concepts —
  `nouns: { object, field, record }` (each `{ one, many }`) — e.g. SQL drivers
  table/column/row, MongoDB collection/field/document, Redis key/field/entry. The
  renderer resolves them through `useDataNouns` (with generic fallbacks) so the
  explorer's search placeholder, group headers, loading/empty states and row
  counts read in the active driver's own terms instead of assuming SQL. Combined
  with the earlier literal-"SQL" string cleanup, the shell no longer hardcodes SQL
  terminology in generic surfaces.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Fix two transaction-session edge cases in query execution (renderer
  orchestration only — session/pool logic stays in the driver adapters):

  - A tab whose selected database differs from the connection's default no longer
    throws "No open session" on its first transactional query. The database/schema
    context is now applied _before_ the session is opened, so the pool-rebuilding
    `switchDatabase` (already idempotent in the adapter) can't wipe the session.
  - Switching a tab's connection now releases the open transactional session on
    the old connection (tolerant no-op when none) and resets the tab's
    transaction status, instead of orphaning the session.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Streamline IPC channel/event definitions so each wire string is authored once.

  Previously every channel name (e.g. `'db:connect'`) was written twice in
  `shared/ipc.ts` — as a key in `IpcChannelMap` and as the value in
  `IPC_CHANNELS` — and kept in sync by hand. The `args`/`return` contracts now
  live in `IpcChannelShapes` (and `IpcEventShapes`) keyed by the constant name,
  the wire string lives only in `IPC_CHANNELS`/`IPC_EVENTS`, and the
  wire-string-keyed `IpcChannelMap`/`IpcEventMap` consumed by `invoke`/`handle`/
  the preload bridge are derived from the two. A `satisfies Record<keyof
IpcChannelShapes, string>` clause makes any drift between the halves a
  compile-time error. No runtime behavior or channel values change; all call
  sites continue to use `IPC_CHANNELS.X` / `IPC_EVENTS.X`.

- [#90](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/90) [`1bce419`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/1bce4195e7e725d88424f5d11a4d286ce081d02a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Break up the largest renderer components for clearer separation of concern.
  No behavior or public-prop changes — each component's logic moved into
  co-located hooks and sub-components:

  - **ConnectionFormView** (518→263 lines) → `connections/form/` (`PluginFieldInput`,
    `FetchableFieldsWizard`, `SshTunnelSection`, `Section`, `ToggleRow`, shared types).
  - **QueryPanel** (463→138) → `useQueryExecution`, `useQueryTransactions`,
    `useQuerySaveDialog` hooks + `SaveQueryDialog`.
  - **App** (452→229) → `useAppKeyboardShortcuts`, `useFileDropForwarding`,
    `useShellMenuEvents` hooks + `ActiveTabView` and `TabCloseGuard`.
  - **TableNode** (364→221) → `useTableNodeActions` hook + shared `TableHoverActions`.
  - **QueryEditor** (277→142) → `useEditorActions`, `useEditorOptions`,
    `useSqlCompletions` hooks + a pure `parseKeybinding` helper (now unit-tested).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/86) [`a5e74c7`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/a5e74c7c1d0354ccedc613e8b2b68fab719370ef) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Driver-declared EXPLAIN, data-grid browse, and database-explorer fixes

  - **EXPLAIN is now driver-declared.** Each driver's `explain` capability carries
    the statement to run (Postgres/MySQL `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, SQLite
    `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`, Snowflake `EXPLAIN`); the app no longer hardcodes a
    dialect, and the Explain action is hidden for drivers that can't explain
    (Redis, MongoDB) — fixing the `ERR unknown command 'EXPLAIN'` on Redis.
  - **Data-grid browse** for non-SQL stores: a new "View data" action opens a
    key/type/value (Redis) or document (Mongo) grid via the driver's own
    `getTableData` reader, shown for any driver that declares `hasGetTableData`.
  - **MySQL explorer** no longer shows server-internal databases and no longer
    mis-nests schemas (MySQL databases are treated as their own schema).
  - **GradientSurface** primitive (accent/neutral × subtle/bold) — used by the
    About modal's hero.
  - Redis browsing now lists a key prefix's keys instead of erroring; the explorer
    shows "No columns" for schema-less stores instead of a stuck "Loading…".

- [#86](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/86) [`a5e74c7`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/a5e74c7c1d0354ccedc613e8b2b68fab719370ef) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - App-designed shell, custom About, and richer diagnostics

  - **Menus & window controls**: replace the native OS application menu on
    Windows/Linux with an app-designed File / Edit / View / Query / Help menu bar
    (our own dropdowns + keyboard-shortcut hints, trimmed to what helps), and
    render the min/max/close window controls with the IconButton primitive.
  - **About**: a custom in-app "About Verql" modal — branded hero panel, app +
    build versions with a copyable build block, MIT license, and resource links —
    replacing the old "open the website" behaviour.
  - **Diagnostics**: a much more detailed in-app activity stream for debugging —
    new event kinds (IPC calls, plugin lifecycle, network/API calls, renderer
    state mutations, performance long-tasks), a structured detail drawer (metadata
    JSON, duration, error stack), a session error/warning summary, and a verbose
    capture toggle.
  - **Design system**: add `size` variants across many primitives and a redesigned
    Switch (pixel-perfect circular thumb, consistent across every theme); normalize
    semantic variant names (Button `danger` → `error`, add `success` to Banner);
    the ColorInput picker now renders in a portal so it can't be clipped; context
    and dropdown menus hug their content.
  - **Fixes**: the "show secondary sidebar" / "show bottom dock" settings now take
    effect live; fill in missing status/accent tokens in the dark, midnight and
    other themes; open external links via Windows interop under WSL; and don't
    crash when OS secret encryption is unavailable (headless / WSL).

### Patch Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/86) [`a5e74c7`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/a5e74c7c1d0354ccedc613e8b2b68fab719370ef) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Redesign the connection form layout into clear, grouped sections. Fields were
  previously stacked full-width in a single column with duplicate labels and
  inconsistent section headers. The form now uses titled cards:

  - **General** — database type, name and color side by side, and an auto-commit
    toggle row.
  - **Connection** — driver fields laid out in a responsive two-column grid (wide
    inputs like passwords, selects, and file pickers span the full width), with
    boolean options grouped into a clean toggle list under an "Options" subheading.
  - **SSH Tunnel** — collapsible card with a description hint.
  - A footer action bar pairs **Test Connection** with **Cancel / Save**.

  Fields are still rendered generically from driver and middleware contributions,
  so the new grid and toggle grouping applies to every database type and any
  plugin-contributed connection fields.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/81) [`3a2f890`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3a2f8906bdd1051d219fa162d7c089df4eafe403) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - v1.0.0 — settings fully plumbed, internationalization, and platform hardening.

  **Settings (every setting now works end-to-end):**

  - Query history backed by the SQLite app-data store (consumes `maxHistoryItems`), surfaced via a Saved/History toggle.
  - Restore open tabs on startup (`restoreTabsOnStartup`).
  - Data display: custom date pattern, boolean display, and text truncation now apply to results.
  - Confirm-on-unsaved-close is honoured; full keybinding rebinding (App-level shortcuts are data-driven; editor already was) with a capture/reset UI.
  - Removed orphaned `connectionDefaults` (autoReconnect / defaultSslMode — SSL is driver-owned) and dead `splitRatio`; typed `pluginGrants`.

  **Internationalization (new subsystem):**

  - Homegrown, dependency-free, cross-process message catalogue (`shared/i18n`) with a typed `t()`/`MessageKey`, ICU-subset interpolation + plurals, a renderer `<I18nProvider>`/`useTranslation`, and a `general.language` setting. All user-facing chrome migrated to it (plugin-authored strings stay plugin-owned). See `docs/i18n.md`.

  **Performance, structure & correctness:**

  - `App` subscribes to stores per-field (no more whole-shell re-render per keystroke).
  - Centralized constants the way IPC channels are: main-process `IPC_EVENTS`, settings category ids, keybinding action ids, and UI panel ids — fixing a broken "Show Schema" command and making settings-open land on the correct category.

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/84) [`30f39e5`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/30f39e5df67dcb68de200f1a3c50b265d5b00f5d) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Cross-platform, app-integrated title bar. The renderer now owns the title bar on
  every OS with a consistent look: macOS keeps its native traffic lights, while
  Windows and Linux get app-drawn window controls (minimize / maximize / close)
  plus an in-title-bar application menu (File / Edit / View / …) that pops the
  native submenus. This fixes the doubled title bar on Windows (native frame +
  app bar) and restores the menu that the custom title bar had hidden.

  Also fixed in this release:

  - **Windows production crash** — `@shared/*` modules were externalised as
    runtime `require()`s (`Cannot find module … shared/settings`) because the
    Vite externalisation guard only recognised POSIX absolute paths. It now uses
    `path.isAbsolute`, so Windows drive-letter paths resolve and the modules are
    bundled.
  - **Windows dev console mojibake** — `pnpm dev` now forces the console to UTF-8
    so tooling glyphs (e.g. `✓`) render correctly instead of `Ô£ô`.

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/81) [`3a2f890`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3a2f8906bdd1051d219fa162d7c089df4eafe403) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Move query-semantic error classification into the drivers (DB-boundary fix [#2](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/issues/2)).
  The renderer previously hardcoded PG/MySQL/SQLite error-message patterns in
  `lib/db-error.ts`. Now:

  - `DbErrorCode` + a serializable `DbErrorRule` live in `shared/db-errors`; an
    `errorRules` capability is added to the `@verql/plugin-sdk` `DriverFactory`
    (additive) and serialized into driver capabilities.
  - The postgresql/mysql/sqlite plugins declare their dialect's rules (bad
    column/table/schema, syntax, constraints, type mismatch, duplicate table,
    division-by-zero, deadlock, aborted txn).
  - `parseDbError(raw, dbType?)` applies the active driver's rules first (regex from
    the driver, friendly message from the renderer's i18n catalogue), then host
    rules for connection/auth/app-layer errors that span drivers. A new driver can
    contribute its own error classification by shipping `errorRules` — no host
    changes. Classification behaviour is unchanged (42-case characterization test).

- [#81](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/81) [`3a2f890`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3a2f8906bdd1051d219fa162d7c089df4eafe403) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Move Postgres EXPLAIN plan parsing out of the renderer into the driver
  (DB-boundary fix [#1](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/issues/1)). The renderer previously hardcoded Postgres plan formats
  (`(cost=…)` text + `FORMAT JSON` keys). Now:

  - `PlanNode` lives in `shared/types`; `DbAdapter` gains an optional
    `parseQueryPlan(result)` (additive to the plugin-author surface).
  - The postgresql plugin owns the parsing; a new `db:parse-plan` IPC delegates to
    the active adapter and returns `[]` when a driver has no plan parser.
  - The renderer stores the parsed tree on the query tab and renders it
    generically; `lib/plan-parser.ts` is removed. Other drivers can now contribute
    plan parsing by implementing `parseQueryPlan`.

  fix [#3](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/issues/3)). Drivers now declare a `statementSyntax` (`'sql'` / `'redis'` /
  `'mongodb'`) on their factory; the renderer's statement registry is keyed by that
  syntax and `StatementGutter` resolves it from the driver's capabilities, instead
  of a hardcoded db-type list in the renderer. A new SQL driver gets the
  "Run/Explain" gutter for free by declaring `statementSyntax: 'sql'`. Adds the
  optional `statementSyntax` field to the `@verql/plugin-sdk` `DriverFactory` type
  (additive). Behaviour for the bundled drivers is unchanged.

  - Extract pure plugin-manifest validation + the symlink walker out of the
    1047-line `plugin-host.ts` into `plugins/manifest-validation.ts` (re-exported
    for compatibility; covered by the existing manifest/audit tests).
  - Collapse the 14 near-identical `tabs.ts` query-tab setters behind
    `patchQueryTab`/`patchTabTxn` helpers.
  - Extract SQL classification (`isSchemaMutatingSql`, `destructiveKind`,
    `stripSqlNoise`) into a tested `lib/sql-classify.ts`, decoupled from i18n.
  - Split the inline `PluginDetailView` tab components and the repeated
    `SchemaNode` object-group blocks into their own modules.
  - Use `IPC_CHANNELS.DB_CONNECTION_OPTIONS` in the connection form instead of a
    hardcoded channel string.

### Minor Changes

- [#80](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/80) [`f7dfeb6`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/f7dfeb69f57ce601cb6b1c70ad460714637e5db1) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Persist AI conversations and saved queries in an internal SQLite app-data store
  instead of renderer `localStorage`. A new main-process `AppDataStore`
  (`${userData}/app.db`, WAL mode) reached over typed `appdata:*` IPC channels
  removes the ~5–10MB `localStorage` quota cap that could silently drop chat
  history, and replaces full-blob rewrites with incremental, transactional writes
  (one write per settled message / saved query). Existing `localStorage` data is
  migrated into the store automatically on first launch.

- [#79](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/79) [`4403452`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/4403452dfaeff2f9a2f08376763548496400c187) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Add native OS notifications for approval prompts. A new bundled
  `os-notifications` plugin surfaces "your response is needed" moments — AI
  write-tool approvals and MCP query authorizations — as desktop notifications
  when Verql is in the background, with user toggles (master enable, only when
  unfocused, approvals). The host gains a delivery-agnostic `attention` seam
  (`src/main/attention/`) that approval flows publish to, and the plugin exposes
  an `os-notifications` service so other plugins can raise desktop notifications.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add an Activity Panel and harden the app against a batch of security and correctness defects.

  - **Activity Panel** — a new secondary-sidebar panel that surfaces recent app activity (connections, queries, errors, and warnings) so you can see what's been happening at a glance.

  Security & correctness fixes:

  - **Secrets never written in cleartext** — saving settings, resetting a category, or deleting a connection no longer rewrites every connection's password into `config.json` in plaintext; keyring-backed fields are stripped before any disk write.
  - **Keyring redaction bypass closed** — the renderer can no longer read AI API keys or DB passwords back out of the keyring; secret-field access is gated and the reserved AI namespace is refused.
  - **AI "explain" stays read-only** — `explain_query` can no longer run writes (e.g. `EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE …`) without approval; the same write-detection used by the MCP server now applies.
  - **Constant-time MCP auth** — the MCP bearer token is now compared with a timing-safe check instead of `!==`.
  - **Redis SSL & database honored** — enabling SSL now actually uses TLS, and the selected database number is respected instead of always connecting to db0 in plaintext.
  - **Tighter plugin isolation** — isolated plugins can only call an explicit allowlist of capability methods, and plugin installs use an atomic private temp dir to avoid symlink/clobber races.
  - **No leaked pools on failed connect** — a failed `db:connect` now releases its adapter instead of leaking a connection pool on every failed attempt.

### Minor Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/72) [`3855e81`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3855e81d0880f64fceb15d6f52f9aa464435b8bc) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Expand what the AI assistant can do in the app. The App-Action registry now ships
  built-in actions for the full capability roadmap, each usable as a clickable chip or
  run directly by the assistant:

  - **Connections** — connect, disconnect, and switch the active connection by name or id.
  - **Schema authoring** — scaffold `CREATE TABLE`/migration SQL into a new query tab (never auto-run).
  - **Results** — export the current results to CSV/JSON, or open a chart of them.
  - **Navigation** — reveal a table (or column) in the explorer, open a saved query, and open the ER diagram with a table selected.
  - **Editor assist** — insert SQL at the cursor or replace the current selection in the active editor.
  - **Plugins** — open the plugin install screen (and settings categories, including plugins).
  - **Diagnostics** — the assistant now sees recent errors/warnings and can summarize them and open the notifications panel.

- [#71](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/71) [`a94b1f3`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/a94b1f39b9e821325958a23b1f54245b43f2d03a) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Enhance the AI chat and surrounding workflow:

  - **Active connection fix** — the assistant now uses the connection you have active in the UI (previously it had no connection and its query/schema tools silently failed).
  - **Refined message bubbles** — avatar-anchored, adaptive width so tables and code never truncate, copy/retry actions, and a suggestion empty state.
  - **Deeper app integration** — the assistant can link you to the right place (e.g. "Add a Connection", "Open ER Diagram") via clickable action chips, and can navigate the app directly through an extensible App-Action registry that plugins can contribute to. The assistant knows your saved connections, so it sends you to the connections list for an existing one and the form only for a new one. Agentic actions report real success/failure back to the chat.
  - **Cheapest model by default** — when a provider is active or you switch vendors, the cheapest model for that vendor is selected by default (you can still pick another).
  - **Connections panel** — row actions moved into an overflow menu, with a new Delete action (confirmed via a dialog).

- [#72](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/72) [`3855e81`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3855e81d0880f64fceb15d6f52f9aa464435b8bc) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - AI chat now keeps a history of conversations and runs leaner:

  - **Conversations** — your chats are saved and listed in a switcher at the top of the AI panel. Start a new chat, rename or delete old ones, and pick up any conversation where you left off (they persist across restarts).
  - **Branching** — fork a new conversation from any message to explore an alternative direction without losing the original thread.
  - **More efficient context** — long conversations no longer send an ever-growing transcript to the model on every turn. The request is trimmed to a token budget (keeping the most recent context), which keeps responses fast and costs down.

- [#75](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/75) [`f732a19`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/f732a191da9c484b2a99d087e3ec950e4c67b69f) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - AI: enable Anthropic prompt caching and externalise every prompt to its own
  markdown file.

  Caching: the system prompt and tool catalog now carry `cache_control:
{ type: 'ephemeral' }` breakpoints when targeting Anthropic models. Anthropic
  keeps a 5-minute prefix cache keyed on these blocks, so cached input tokens
  cost ~10% of the normal rate and skip re-processing on the server — the
  single biggest TTFT win on multi-turn chats with a stable schema.

  Externalised prompts: the five AI prompts (chat system, explain, generate
  query, inline SQL completion, summarize) and the chat-system context
  fragments now live as `.md` files in
  `src/main/plugins/bundled/ai/prompts/`, imported via Vite's `?raw` and
  rendered with a tiny `{{placeholder}}` helper. No prompt prose lives in the
  AI layer code anymore. New `tests/unit/ai-prompts.test.ts` pins the
  structural anchors that callers depend on (cursor token, section headers,
  word limits) so prompt edits can't silently break the surrounding code.

  statement gutter (lucide icons + per-statement status chip); add an
  Accept/Reject toolbar and status pill to inline AI ghost-text; rebuild the
  Explain-results panel with Markdown, streaming, Copy/Regenerate/Ask-follow-up
  actions. No ASCII glyphs remain in the touched surfaces.

- [#72](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/72) [`3855e81`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/3855e81d0880f64fceb15d6f52f9aa464435b8bc) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - SQL formatting, in-app help, and docs:

  - **Format query** — the editor can now pretty-print the buffer ("Format Document" / Shift+Alt+F, or ask the assistant to "format this"). Formatting is plugin-owned and keyed by editor language: SQL drivers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Snowflake) contribute dialect formatters backed by `sql-formatter`, MongoDB pretty-prints its JSON, and Redis tidies its command buffer. New database plugins can contribute a formatter for their own query language via the new `formatters` contribution surface.
  - **Help menu** — a native Help menu links to the documentation and issue tracker, and the About panel shows the version (macOS/Linux).
  - **Docs** — added `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/ai.md`, documented the formatter surface in `docs/plugins.md`, and refreshed `CLAUDE.md` with a docs-first workflow and the glue↔plugin ownership boundary.

  GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq (missing buffer bounds check in v3/v5/v6). Our usage path
  through snowflake-sdk only touches v4, but the audit gate flagged it; the
  override moves us to a maintained line.

  names (instead of full column schemas) with a hint to call describe_table on
  demand, compact the App-Action catalog to `id "Title"` pairs, omit the active
  connection from the "saved connections" list, and cap recent notifications at
  three titles. Cuts per-turn prompt size by ~2-5k tokens on typical workspaces.

Database tool logic now lives in a dedicated always-on `db-tools` bundled plugin consumed by both the MCP server and the AI assistant (clean break: `ctx.ai.registerTool` is removed in favour of `ctx.tools`). The MCP settings panel gains per-tool enable toggles, a read-only mode, a configurable row limit, automatic port-conflict resolution, and a live activity log. SQL in the MCP approval dialog and the Claude client config are now syntax-highlighted via a new reusable `CodeView` primitive.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/54) [`d2e6c88`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/d2e6c8894dac9735305078cbc52de601aa816373) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Added transaction controls for PostgreSQL and SQLite connections. Each query tab can now turn off auto-commit and run statements inside a transaction, with Commit/Rollback, isolation level, and read-only mode in a new transaction toolbar. A connection can default to manual-commit via a per-connection "Auto-commit by default" setting, and closing a tab with an open transaction prompts you to commit or roll back first.

  Under the hood, drivers declare these capabilities through a new plugin-SDK session/transaction surface, so the UI stays database-agnostic — future drivers (MySQL, Snowflake, MongoDB, Redis) light up the same controls just by declaring support.

Connection, database, and plugin status are now shown as discrete segments along the bar, replacing the previous ConnectionCard layout.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/51) [`876f08e`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/876f08e153e05f9b8d4b4aa5a860d8ac99783f73) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - The main app is now a pure orchestrator: every line of database-specific logic lives inside its driver plugin. Adding a new database (Cassandra, ClickHouse, DuckDB, anything else) no longer requires editing the main process or the renderer's hot paths.

  What changed for the user-facing app:

  - Each driver now contributes its own identifier-quote character, prepared-statement placeholder, sample query, and migration DDL builder. The orchestrator routes through these structural capabilities; the previous hardcoded "for these four dialects" table is gone.
  - The CSV-into-table importer is fully generic — it asks the active driver for its quoting + placeholder shape, so the same import path works for every relational driver (bundled or third-party).
  - SQLite's `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` rowid quirk during migration moved into the SQLite plugin where it belongs. The migration tool no longer special-cases it.
  - The `db:sample-query` IPC handler no longer fabricates a `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 100` fallback. Every driver, SQL or otherwise, ships its own sample-query implementation.
  - Bundled drivers are now wired through a single `src/main/plugins/bundled/index.ts` list. The orchestrator iterates that list — it doesn't reference individual driver names anywhere else.

  What changed for plugin authors: see the SDK release notes below — the helpers driver plugins compose (`quoteIdentifier`, `generateCreateTable`, `splitSqlStatements`, `importCsvToTable`, `createRelationalGetTableData`) now live in the public SDK barrel and take the driver's quote character as a parameter, so a new driver plugin never has to hardcode a dialect name.

  A regression test now scans every file under `src/main/` outside `plugins/` and fails the build if any of `'postgresql'`, `'mysql'`, `'sqlite'`, `'mongodb'`, `'redis'`, `'snowflake'` re-appears in core code.

- [#51](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/51) [`876f08e`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/876f08e153e05f9b8d4b4aa5a860d8ac99783f73) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - The plugin SDK is now a complete, documented surface for third-party plugin authors, and themes are validated end-to-end so a partial theme can never half-paint the app.

  **Plugin SDK additions**

  - `definePlugin({ manifest, activate, deactivate? })` — typed identity helper that pins the plugin shape at compile time. Missing fields or mistyped contributions fail at compile time instead of at boot.
  - SQL helpers exposed in the public barrel: `quoteIdentifier`, `validateIdentifier`, `formatSqlValue`, `generateCreateTable`, `generateInsertStatements`, `splitSqlStatements`, `importCsvToTable`, `createRelationalGetTableData`. All take the driver's `quoteChar` as a parameter — no dialect enum.
  - Theme helpers exposed: `validateTheme`, `REQUIRED_THEME_TOKENS`, `RECOMMENDED_THEME_TOKENS`. Plugin authors can run the same validator the host runs and fail their own CI before shipping a broken theme.
  - Manifest validator now covers `themes`, `exporters`, and `importers` contributions (previously silently accepted any shape and failed later at activation time).

  **Theme validation**

  - The theme registry validates every theme at registration time and stores the report on the entry. The picker reads it once instead of re-running validation per render.
  - Optional `register(theme, { strict: true })` throws on missing required tokens — useful inside a plugin author's CI build.
  - The Appearance settings theme grid now **disables** tiles for themes missing required tokens — they're greyed out, non-clickable, and show a tooltip listing the missing tokens. Themes that only miss _recommended_ tokens still work and show the existing warning badge.
  - `setTheme()` refuses to land on a broken theme even when called programmatically (URL handler, command palette, restored settings), and the resolved-theme fallback skips broken themes when picking the effective theme for the active mode.
  - The 9 bundled themes (Lab, Ink & Paper, Dark, Light, Midnight, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, Catppuccin) are pinned by a unit test against the required-token list, so a future palette tweak can't silently break one.

  **Documentation**

  `docs/plugins.md` has been updated for the new SDK surface: `definePlugin`, the driver capability flags (`quoteChar`, `placeholder`, `sampleQuery`, `generateMigrationDdl`), the theme-token contract, and the bundled-plugins/index.ts wiring file.

### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/51) [`876f08e`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/876f08e153e05f9b8d4b4aa5a860d8ac99783f73) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Round of correctness fixes surfaced by a full-codebase audit:

  - **Schema cache is cleared on disconnect.** Reconnecting a profile no longer surfaces stale tables/columns from the previous session, which would otherwise cause confusing autocomplete and the occasional "table doesn't exist" against the live server.
  - **Tabs detach cleanly when their connection is deleted.** Query tabs lose their dead `connectionId` and land in the "pick a connection" state; ER-diagram and table tabs close outright instead of dangling against a profile that no longer exists.
  - **CSV import "update on conflict"** no longer silently drops every conflicting row. Per-row failures now surface in the importer's `errors[]` so the user can see what failed, instead of seeing a successful import that didn't actually write anything.
  - **Adapters disconnect cleanly on app quit.** A new `before-quit` handler awaits every active adapter's `disconnect()`, so SSH tunnels and database pools close before the process exits rather than getting reaped abruptly.
  - **`Close all tabs` no longer reverses the open tab list** for any subscriber still holding the prior reference. The action now copies the array before reversing it.
  - **Disconnect middleware errors are logged** instead of being swallowed by an empty `catch {}`, so a leaking SSH tunnel or socket is discoverable in the developer console instead of vanishing.
  - **Command-palette plugin actions** log their errors instead of disappearing into a no-op `.catch(() => {})`.

- [#51](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/51) [`876f08e`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/876f08e153e05f9b8d4b4aa5a860d8ac99783f73) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Security hardening across connection, IPC, and plugin loading paths:

  - **PostgreSQL SSL** now verifies the server certificate by default whenever SSL is enabled, instead of silently disabling verification on every encrypted connection. The connection form gains an explicit _SSL Mode_ selector — pick "Verify (recommended)" or "Skip verification (insecure)" — so opt-out is deliberate, not a hidden default.
  - **MCP server** no longer returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. The bearer-token check still gates every request, but removing the wildcard means even a leaked token can't be read by a malicious page in the user's browser.
  - **MCP `explain_query` tool** now routes through the same write-approval gate as `query`. Statements that hide DML behind a comment or after a semicolon (`EXPLAIN SELECT 1; DELETE FROM users`) can no longer be smuggled through the "read-only" label.
  - **Bundled plugins can no longer be shadowed.** A third-party plugin claiming the name `verql-plugin-postgresql` (or any other bundled name) is now rejected at discover and install time instead of silently overriding the built-in driver and intercepting credentials.
  - **Plugin `main` path traversal** is rejected at the validate phase. A manifest declaring `main: '../../../etc/passwd.js'` (or any absolute path) can no longer escape the plugin directory and load arbitrary files via `require()`.
  - **Encrypted credentials file** (`credentials.enc`) is now written with mode `0o600` so it isn't world-readable on shared systems.
  - **Main window** declares `setWindowOpenHandler` (denies all `window.open` requests) and a `will-navigate` guard pinned to the bundled assets / dev server, so the renderer can never be steered to an external URL.

When the running install is managed by Homebrew, you can check for a new version and trigger `brew upgrade --cask verql` from inside the app, then restart to apply. The mechanism is channel-pluggable — Mac App Store, Windows Store, Snap and APT can drop in later without changes to the UI or IPC layer.

Previously the choice was kept only in memory, so every boot re-activated every installed plugin and the disable toggle appeared to do nothing across sessions.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/47) [`ea26f17`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/ea26f171f48a68e12f89ae308757dc3342ea14ee) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Redesigned the workspace tab bar in a browser-style: each tab now has rounded top corners and curved skirt corners that visually attach the active tab to the workspace below.

  Introduced five new theme tokens — `--color-tab-bar-bg`, `--color-tab-active-bg`, `--color-tab-active-fg`, `--color-tab-inactive-fg`, `--color-tab-hover-bg` — so themes (bundled and plugin-contributed) can tune tab contrast independently from the underlying surface palette. All nine plugin themes plus the baseline Nightshift were updated with values that keep the active tab clearly distinct from the bar, including on light themes where the previous hover wash blended into the background.

- [#47](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/47) [`ea26f17`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/ea26f171f48a68e12f89ae308757dc3342ea14ee) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Nightshift is now owned by the app shell rather than the core-themes plugin. Its CSS variables already lived in the always-loaded baseline; this release moves the Monaco editor definition into the renderer alongside, so the brand syntax highlighting works even with every plugin disabled. The renderer always prepends Nightshift to the theme list and ignores any plugin attempting to register the same id, keeping the brand surface authoritative. The core-themes plugin now ships nine themes (Lab, Ink & Paper, Dark, Light, Midnight, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, Catppuccin).

  The pre-React boot splash now uses the real Verql brand mark (frost-and-mint V-bars) instead of the placeholder chevron, matching the React-side splash so the loading-to-app handoff doesn't swap symbols.

### Patch Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/pull/47) [`ea26f17`](https://github.com/arshad-shah/verql/commit/ea26f171f48a68e12f89ae308757dc3342ea14ee) Thanks [@arshad-shah](https://github.com/arshad-shah)! - Light themes (Light, Lab, Ink & Paper) now render correctly:

  - The Light theme's selected-state and status colors (accent emphasis, success, warning, error, info) no longer fall back to the Nightshift baseline's mint/amber palette that washed out on white surfaces.
  - The Color Mode toggle (Light / Dark / System) on Lab and Ink & Paper themes had dark text on a dark accent-muted background; the accent-muted token is now a translucent tint suitable for selected-state backgrounds on light surfaces.
  - The Lab and Ink & Paper themes are now declared as `color-scheme: light` so native form controls render with the correct UA palette.

  Removed the duplicate `<Heading>` element from every Settings category — the settings layout already shows the category name in its header, so each page no longer renders two headings stacked on top of each other.

  Removed nine orphaned theme CSS files from `src/renderer/src/primitives/theme/themes/` that hadn't been imported since themes migrated to the plugin registry. The directory is gone; baseline Nightshift in `baseline.css` is the only renderer-bundled theme stylesheet.

Previously, plugins that contributed only exporters or importers — like Core Formats — appeared blank because the plugin host's contribution-verification loop didn't track those kinds, so nothing flowed through to the UI. The verification path now covers exporters and importers, and the settings page renders the full contribution list.

- **New default theme: Nightshift.** Plus two more curated themes — Lab (refined light) and Ink & Paper (warm editorial) — bringing the total to three primary directions before legacy/community themes.

  - `nightshift` (default) — modern dark with an electric mint accent (`#2bd9a3`)
  - `lab` — refined off-white with a deep teal accent (`#115E59`)
  - `inkpaper` — warm editorial paper-toned light with a rust accent (`#9E3022`)

  Old themes (`dark`, `light`, `midnight`, `dracula`, `nord`, `solarized`, `catppuccin`) remain available for users who prefer them. Existing user theme preferences are preserved across upgrade.

  Also wired up the **animations** appearance toggle — it now actually disables transitions app-wide instead of being a no-op switch. `ThemeProvider` writes `data-animations="off"` to `<html>`, and a global CSS rule kills `transition-duration` / `animation-duration` when set.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- Permanently fix `Cannot find module` crashes at launch by bundling pure-JS main-process dependencies (snowflake-sdk, axios, form-data, mongodb, ioredis, …) into `out/main/index.js` via Rollup, plus switch pnpm to `nodeLinker: hoisted` (pnpm's own recommendation for Electron projects).

  Previously, electron-builder's dep-graph walker silently dropped transitive deps under pnpm's isolated layout — `es-object-atoms`, `mime-db`, `get-intrinsic`, `call-bind-apply-helpers`, … all went missing from the packaged `app.asar` even when they were present at top-level `node_modules` locally. Bundling inlines them so runtime resolution never reaches the filesystem.

  Only native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `pg`, `mysql2`, `ssh2`, `cpu-features`) and `@electron/rebuild` remain external — those still ship in `node_modules` inside the asar and are packed reliably because they're declared direct dependencies.

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix `Cannot find module` crashes at launch by including the full transitive node_modules graph in the packaged `app.asar`. The previous `files: ["out/**/*"]` config left it to electron-builder's default dep-walker, which (under pnpm's symlinked layout) silently dropped many transitive deps — `mime-db`, `es-object-atoms`, `get-intrinsic`, `es-set-tostringtag`, and others all went missing. Switched to explicit `files` patterns that pull in `node_modules/**/*` with sensible excludes (changelogs, tests, docs, source maps).

  Asar package count: 353 → 434.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix `Cannot find module 'mime-db'` crash at launch (still hitting users on v0.3.3). Despite `shamefullyHoist: true` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` placing `mime-db` at the top of `node_modules` locally, the same install on macos-14 CI runners didn't include it in the packaged `app.asar` — snowflake-sdk's nested `mime-types` then couldn't resolve `mime-db` at runtime.

  Declared `mime-db@1.52.0` and `mime-types@2.1.35` as direct dependencies so electron-builder's dep-graph walker always packs them regardless of pnpm layout quirks.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix release workflow dropping the Windows `.exe` from the release assets. With the new `artifactName` template the installer is named `verql-X.Y.Z-x64.exe` instead of `verql Setup X.Y.Z.exe`; the `*Setup*.exe` globs in the SHA computation and the upload step missed it. Switched both to `*.exe`.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Force lowercase artifact filenames via explicit `artifactName` template (`${name}-${version}-${arch}.${ext}`). electron-builder previously derived names from `productName` ("Verql" with a capital V), producing `Verql-0.3.1-arm64.dmg` etc. — which mismatched the lowercase URLs in the Homebrew cask and broke the auto-bump workflow's asset download. Both architectures now carry an explicit `-x64` / `-arm64` suffix; workflow and cask updated to match.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix macOS release build failing with `DOMParser.parseFromString: the provided mimeType "undefined" is not valid`. The `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.9 line made the `mimeType` argument mandatory; the `plist` library that electron-builder uses to parse the Electron prebuild's `Info.plist` doesn't pass one. Pin `@xmldom/xmldom` to `~0.8.13` via pnpm overrides.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Rebrand from Nova to Verql** — the previous name conflicted with existing trademarks.

  - Project, repo (`arshad-shah/nova` → `arshad-shah/verql`), package (`nova` → `verql`), and Homebrew tap (`arshad-shah/homebrew-nova` → `arshad-shah/homebrew-verql`) are all renamed.
  - macOS bundle identifier changes from `com.electron.nova` to `com.electron.verql`; settings paths under `~/Library/Application Support/` move accordingly.
  - Existing Homebrew installs need to be reinstalled: `brew uninstall --cask arshad-shah/nova/nova` and then `brew install --cask arshad-shah/verql/verql`.

  **Other fixes bundled with the rebrand:**

  - **pnpm-workspace.yaml** is now the source of truth for pnpm config. The previous `.npmrc` setting `shamefully-hoist=true` was silently ignored by pnpm 11; switching to `shamefullyHoist: true` in this file makes the hoist take effect. Without hoisting, transitive deps (e.g., `mime-db` pulled in by `snowflake-sdk` → `mime-types`) were dropped from the packaged `app.asar` and the app crashed at launch with `Cannot find module 'mime-db'`.
  - Explicit `build.appId` (`com.electron.verql`) and `build.productName` (`Verql`) so the bundle, dock label, and Info.plist all carry the proper brand instead of falling back to the lowercase package name.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix macOS `.dmg` rejected with "verql is damaged and can't be opened". With `mac.identity: null`, electron-builder was skipping signing entirely, leaving every nested binary with its stale Electron-prebuild linker signature while the bundle's resource hashes (Info.plist, app.asar, icons) no longer matched. macOS rejected the app at launch (`spctl: code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present`).

  Adds an `afterPack` hook that ad-hoc re-signs the assembled bundle with `codesign --force --deep --sign -` before the dmg is created. Every nested binary now ends up with a consistent ad-hoc signature, matching resource hashes, and a null Team ID — so Gatekeeper accepts the bundle even without an Apple Developer ID.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix macOS `.dmg` crashing on launch with `Library not loaded: Electron Framework ... mapping process and mapped file ... have different Team IDs`. Without `mac.identity: null`, electron-builder left the embedded Electron Framework's original signature intact while the outer binary was ad-hoc signed, so dyld refused to load nested frameworks at runtime. Setting `identity: null` forces consistent ad-hoc signing across every nested binary.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix release workflow hashing step on macOS. macOS runners don't ship GNU `sha256sum`; use the platform's available hasher (`shasum -a 256` on macOS, `sha256sum` on Linux/Windows runners) so the artifact SHA file is produced on every platform.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix macOS release build when no Apple signing certificate is configured. The previous workflow set `CSC_LINK: ""` which electron-builder treated as a path to the project root, failing with `not a file`. Now sets `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` when `MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64` is unset, producing an unsigned bundle instead.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix release workflow: run `electron-vite build` before `electron-builder` so the packaged `app.asar` contains `out/main/index.js`. Without this step all three OS builds failed at the asar sanity check during the v0.2.0 release attempt.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release of Verql — a fast, extensible desktop database client built on Electron + React.

  - **Database drivers** (each a bundled plugin): PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Snowflake.
  - **SQL editor** powered by Monaco with per-dialect autocomplete and code lens.
  - **Schema browser** with ER diagrams, table previews, and a row inspector.
  - **Import/export** for CSV, JSON, JSON-Lines, and SQL — all as plugin contributions.
  - **AI assistant** with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama providers; per-query permission gating for tool calls.
  - **MCP server** built in, so Claude Code and other MCP clients can read schemas and run approved queries.
  - **SSH tunnels** as connection middleware.
  - **Themes**: dark, light, midnight — three-layer token system for further customisation.

  Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are attached to this release. macOS and Windows builds are currently **unsigned**; see the README for verification steps using `sha256sums.txt` and the detached GPG signature.

The 0.1.0 entry below is the consolidated history from the project's
private prototype phase through to first public release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - First public release

The initial release of Verql as an open-source project. Highlights of
the prototype phase that fed into 0.1.0:

### Application shell

- Three-panel workbench: primary sidebar with the connection explorer,
  centre area with tabbed editors / table views, secondary sidebar
  for context-aware panels.
- Bottom dock for query plans, charts, and plugin-contributed views.
- Inspector panel that reflects the user's current selection (row,
  column, schema object).
- Command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) that surfaces every Monaco editor
  action plus app commands and any plugin-contributed commands.
- Native macOS / Linux / Windows menu and accelerators.

### Database support

- Native drivers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Snowflake, MongoDB,
  and Redis.
- Schema introspection: tables, views, columns, indexes, foreign keys,
  materialised views, functions, triggers, sequences, extensions
  (per-driver coverage varies).
- ER diagram generation (`@xyflow/react` + dagre).
- Per-driver Monaco completion providers with static keywords plus
  dynamic table / column completions.
- AI-assisted inline completion in the SQL editor.
- Connection middleware support, with a bundled SSH tunnel middleware.

### Query editor

- Monaco-powered editor with per-driver language selection (`sql`,
  `json` for Mongo, `plaintext` for Redis).
- Code lens with inline "▶ Run / Explain" buttons.
- Per-action keybinding configuration in Settings.
- Query plan tab and charts tab in the bottom dock.

### Import / export

- CSV and JSON import / export for every driver, contributed by a
  `core-formats` bundled plugin.
- SQL exporter + importer contributed by each relational driver
  plugin (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Snowflake) — uses dialect-aware
  identifier quoting.
- JSON-Lines + JSON-Array exporter for MongoDB; JSON exporter for
  Redis.

### AI assistant

- Bundled providers: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Ollama.
- Per-tool permission gating; write operations require user approval.
- Built-in tools: list tables, describe table, get relationships,
  connection info, execute query, generate SQL, complete SQL, explain
  results.
- AI keys stored encrypted at rest via Electron `safeStorage`.

### MCP server

- Optional built-in MCP server that exposes the active connection to
  external AI tools (Claude Code, etc.).
- Bearer token authentication; user must explicitly start the server
  in Settings.

### Plugin system (extension surfaces)

- Discover → validate → resolve → activate → verify lifecycle.
- Manifest validation enforced equally for bundled and external
  plugins.
- Per-plugin error budget auto-disables a plugin that throws
  repeatedly at runtime.
- Contribution surfaces:
  - drivers (with `sqlDialect`, `editorLanguage`,
    `defaultSchemaCandidates`, `getTableData`)
  - exporters / importers
  - type mappers
  - connection middleware
  - completion providers
  - panels (primary / secondary / bottom dock)
  - commands (with keybindings)
  - declarative UI widgets (toolbar selectors, status bar items,
    slots and resolvers)
  - AI providers / tools / context providers
  - settings (per-plugin, mounted into core categories)
- Plugins can be installed from a directory or a zip via the
  Extensions panel.

### Security

- Renderer sandboxed: `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true`,
  `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity: true`.
- All SQL identifier interpolation goes through `quoteIdentifier()`,
  which rejects NUL / CR / LF / tab and caps length at 255.
- Secrets stored encrypted via OS-keyring-backed `safeStorage`;
  legacy plain-text secrets are migrated on first launch.
- Bundled CI dependency audit (`pnpm audit --audit-level high`).
- Zero known high or critical dependency vulnerabilities.

### Architecture refactors that fed into 0.1.0

- Driver-driven extension model: removed every hardcoded
  `connectionType === '…'` branch from the orchestrator and renderer.
  Drivers contribute capability flags (`sqlDialect`,
  `defaultSchemaCandidates`, `editorLanguage`, …) that the generic
  code paths read.
- `TypeMapperRegistry` for cross-dialect type translation —
  migration code is dialect-agnostic.
- `IPC_CHANNELS` / `IPC_EVENTS` constants in `shared/ipc.ts` as the
  single source of truth for every renderer ↔ main channel. Coverage
  test enforces that no call site uses an inline string literal.
- Plugin-driven import / export — formats register themselves through
  the SDK; the orchestrator never imports a concrete exporter.

### Tooling

- 834 unit tests, runnable under `pnpm test --project unit`.
- Storybook for primitives + components.
- TypeScript strict mode across the codebase; `tsc -b` is part of CI.
- GitHub Actions CI: unit tests on Node 20 + 22, typecheck, dependency
  audit, and a production `electron-vite build`.
