# The AI assistant

The AI assistant is a **bundled plugin** (`src/main/plugins/bundled/ai/`).
Nothing in the core app knows about OpenAI or Anthropic; the plugin registers
providers, tools, and IPC handlers through the SDK at activation, exactly like a
driver plugin registers a database.

This doc covers how a chat turn flows end to end, the tool system shared with
MCP, the App-Action registry that lets the AI act on the UI, conversation
history, and how the orchestrator keeps requests bounded.

## Process split

| Runs in | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| **main** (`bundled/ai/internal/`) | provider API calls, the tool loop, permission gating, conversation state for the current turn |
| **renderer** (`stores/ai.ts`, `components/ai/`) | chat UI, conversation history + persistence, the App-Action registry, approval prompts |
| **shared** (`shared/ai-types.ts`) | message/event/request types crossing the IPC boundary |

The renderer never calls a provider directly. It sends `ai:chat:start` and
streams `ai:chat:event` broadcasts back. All AI IPC channels live under the
`ai:*` prefix in [`shared/ipc.ts`](../shared/ipc.ts) (see [ipc.md](./ipc.md)).

## Providers and models

`AIProviderRegistry` holds the registered providers and tracks the active
provider + model id. Three providers ship in the box:

- `providers/openai.ts`, `providers/anthropic.ts`, `providers/ollama.ts`

Each implements the `AIProvider` interface (`internal/types.ts`): `models()`
(lists models with a `contextWindow` and a `costTier`) and `chat(request)` (an
async generator of `{ type: 'text' | 'tool-call' | 'done' | 'error', … }`
chunks). API keys live in the OS keyring under the `__ai__` namespace, never in
`settings.json` (a one-time migration moves any legacy plaintext key out).

When a provider becomes active, the cheapest model for that vendor is selected
by default (`pick-cheapest-model.ts`), unless the user already chose one.

## Tools: the shared ToolRegistry

Tool calling is unified across the AI chat and the built-in MCP server. Both
read the **same** `ToolRegistry` (`sdk/tool-registry.ts`), constructed once in
`ipc-handlers.ts` and handed to every plugin. A `Tool` (`sdk/types.ts`):

```ts
interface Tool {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  inputSchema: z.ZodObject     // validated + converted to JSON Schema for the LLM
  permission: 'read' | 'write'
  surfaces?: Array<'ai' | 'mcp'>   // omitted = both
  execute(params, ctx: ToolContext): Promise<ToolResult>
}
```

- The canonical database tools (`query`, `explain_query`, `list_tables`,
  `describe_table`, `get_schemas`, `connection_info`) are registered by the
  `db-tools` bundled plugin and are visible to **both** AI and MCP.
- `surfaces: ['ai']` scopes a tool to the chat only — the headless MCP server
  never sees it. `perform_app_action` (below) is AI-only for this reason.
- `permission: 'write'` tools route through the `PermissionManager`: the loop
  emits an `approval-request` event and waits for the user's
  `ai:chat:approval-response` before executing.

## App actions: deep links and agentic UI

"App actions" are named, parameterized things the assistant can point the user
to or perform inside the renderer — opening a panel, a query tab, connecting to
a database, exporting results. They are the single source of truth behind two
surfaces, so a new action lights up both with no extra wiring.

The registry lives in the **renderer** (`lib/app-actions/`):

```ts
interface AppAction {
  id: string                       // used in verql://action/<id> links + tool calls
  title: string                    // human label on chips / in the catalog
  description: string              // shown to the AI in the system prompt
  kind: 'navigation' | 'mutating'  // gates agentic execution
  params?: Record<string, AppActionParam>
  run: (params) => void | Promise<void>
}
```

Built-ins are registered at startup (`builtins.ts`, via `registerBuiltinAppActions()`
in `App.tsx`); plugins can register their own through the same `appActions.register`
API, so any plugin destination becomes referenceable by the AI automatically.

**Two surfaces, one registry:**

1. **Deep-link chips (user-clicked).** The assistant writes a markdown link with
   a `verql://action/<id>?param=value` href. `MarkdownContent`'s link renderer
   intercepts that scheme (`parse.ts`) and renders an `ActionChip` instead of an
   anchor. Clicking it runs the action. `mutating` chips confirm first.
2. **Agentic tool (AI-initiated).** The AI calls the `perform_app_action` tool
   (registered in `internal/index.ts`, `surfaces: ['ai']`). Because tools run in
   **main** but actions run in the **renderer**, the tool broadcasts
   `app:action:perform` with a correlation id; the renderer bridge (`bridge.ts`)
   runs the action and reports the outcome back over `app:action:result`, so the
   tool result honestly reflects success/failure. **Only `navigation` actions
   run agentically** — the bridge refuses `mutating` ones, which must go through
   a user-clicked chip.

The AI learns the catalog because the renderer sends `appActions.describeForPrompt()`
on every `ai:chat:start`, and `ConversationManager.assembleSystemMessage()`
appends it with usage rules. See `builtins.ts` for the full list (connect /
disconnect / switch connection, open a query tab, scaffold DDL, export results,
open a chart, reveal a table, open a saved query, ER diagram, insert into the
editor, settings, notifications, …).

## The orchestration loop

`ConversationManager.chat()` (`internal/conversation-manager.ts`) is an async
generator that drives one user turn to completion:

1. **Assemble the system prompt** — base rules + the connected driver, the
   current schema summary, registered context providers, the saved-connections
   summary, a recent-notifications summary (for diagnostics), and the app-action
   catalog.
2. **Budget the context.** The full transcript is kept in memory for display and
   persistence, but only a trimmed copy is sent each round.
   `token-estimate.ts` gives a cheap `chars/4` estimate; `trimMessagesToBudget`
   keeps the system prompt plus the most recent turns within
   `maxContextTokens` (default 24k), always retaining the newest message and
   never leading with an orphaned tool result. This stops a long conversation
   from growing the request — and the bill — without bound.
3. **Stream + tool loop.** Text chunks are forwarded as `chunk` events. On a
   `tool-call`: resolve the tool, gate `write` tools through approval, execute
   via `toolRegistry.execute(id, params, { connectionId, abortSignal })`, and
   feed the result back. Loops up to `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` (10) until the model
   answers with no further tool calls.

The connection id is threaded **per request** from the renderer (the UI's active
connection), overriding the ambient one, so the tools always run against the
database the user is actually looking at.

## Conversation history

The renderer owns conversations and persists them to `localStorage`
(`verql:ai-conversations`), the same pattern as saved queries. State and actions
live in `stores/ai.ts`:

```ts
interface Conversation {
  id: string
  title: string                // auto-derived from the first user message
  messages: AIChatMessage[]
  stats: SessionStats          // per-conversation token / tool-call totals
  createdAt: number
  updatedAt: number
}
```

- `newConversation` / `switchConversation` / `deleteConversation` /
  `renameConversation` / `branchConversation` manage the list; `ConversationMenu`
  is the switcher at the top of the panel.
- **Branching** (`branchConversation(messageId)`, surfaced as the branch button
  on a message) forks a new conversation containing the history up to that
  message, leaving the original intact.
- A module-level store subscription keeps the active conversation in sync with
  the live message/stat state and writes through to `localStorage`.

Because the main process starts each launch with no history, the renderer pushes
the relevant transcript to main via **`ai:messages:set`** (→
`ConversationManager.setMessages`) on switch, on branch, and once on startup for
the restored active conversation. Otherwise continuing a restored chat would send
only the new message and lose context.

## Enhancements

Separate from tool-calling chat, `internal/enhancements.ts` exposes three direct
one-shot provider calls used by the editor and results UI:

| Channel | Used by | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ai:generate-sql` | `NLInputBar` | natural language → SQL |
| `ai:complete-sql` | inline completion provider | ghost-text completion |
| `ai:explain-results` | results panel | explain a result set |

These don't go through the conversation loop or tools.

## Renderer state and UI

`stores/ai.ts` (`useAIStore`) holds messages, streaming state, providers/models,
approvals, per-session stats, and the conversation list. It listens for
`ai:chat:event` and applies each `AIStreamEvent` (`handleStreamEvent`).

Components in `components/ai/`:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ChatPanel` | panel shell: `ConversationMenu` + `SessionInfo` + `MessageThread` + `ChatInput` |
| `ConversationMenu` | conversation switcher: new / switch / rename / delete |
| `MessageThread` | renders the message list + empty-state suggestion chips |
| `MessageBubble` | a user/assistant bubble; hosts copy / retry / branch actions |
| `ToolCallCard` | a tool call's status, arguments, and result (resolves `perform_app_action` ids to titles) |
| `ApprovalCard` | approval prompt for `write` tools |
| `MarkdownContent` | assistant markdown; intercepts `verql://action/*` → `ActionChip` |
| `ActionChip` | clickable deep-link pill backed by an `AppAction` |
| `SessionInfo` | message / tool-call / token counts for the active conversation |
