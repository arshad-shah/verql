# Exploring your schema

Beyond running queries, Verql helps you *understand* a database: what tables
exist, how they relate, and what's inside them. This page covers the schema
browser, ER diagrams, table previews, the inspector, and charts.

## The schema browser

When you connect, Verql introspects the database and shows its structure in the
sidebar — tables, views, columns, indexes, and more (exact coverage varies by
database). Expand items to drill into the detail.

The schema is cached per connection for speed and cleared when you disconnect,
so a fresh connection always reflects the live database.

## ER diagrams

Verql can render an **entity-relationship diagram** of your schema, drawn with
[xyflow](https://xyflow.com/). Tables appear as nodes and foreign-key
relationships as the edges between them, so you can see at a glance how things
connect. Pan and zoom to explore large schemas.

## Table previews

To peek at a table's contents without writing SQL, open a **table preview**.
Verql asks the active driver for a sensible sample of rows and shows them in the
same results grid you get from queries — so you can sort, select, and inspect
just like query output.

## The inspector panel

The **inspector** reflects whatever you currently have selected — a row, a
column, or a schema object — and lays out its details in a readable form. Select
a row in any grid to see its full set of values, which is handy when a row is too
wide to read comfortably across the grid.

## Chart panel

The **chart panel**, built with [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), turns query
results into a quick visualisation — a fast way to eyeball trends or
distributions without leaving the app. Run a query, then send its results to the
chart panel to plot them.
